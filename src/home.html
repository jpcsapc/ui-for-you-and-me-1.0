        <div class="main-container">
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <!-- Again, it is divided into two columns:
                     (1) sidebar for navigating the site
                     (2) the content, (article, info, etc.)
                     Since we only have two columns, we'll reuse the names that
                     we used earlier in the class attribute for the header, so,
                     for the sidebar, we'll call it the left-column.
                     
                     If you've noticed, we've also included an "id" attribute.
                     The main difference between the "id" and "class" attributes
                     is we use the "id" for elements that are unique in the sense
                     that we want to style it differently from the rest while
                     "class" is for elements that we'd want to have the same
                     styling/style applied across the page. -->
                <div id="sidebar" class="left-column">
                    <!-- It is best practice to enclose navigation elements using
                         the <nav> element, and use <li> or list items for the
                         pages/links that we'd include here. The reason for this
                         is we want the page to be accessible for everyone,
                         (i.e. disabled people who will visit your page.)-->
                    <nav>
                        <!-- The first list item in our navigation is the home page.
                             The <a> or anchor element tells the browser that this
                             specific text should be "clickable" and will redirect
                             the user to the web page that we specify in
                             the "href" attribute. -->
                        <li><a href="home.html" class="active">Home</a></li>
                        <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
                        <li><a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a></li>
                        <li><a href="services.html">Services</a></li>
                    </nav>
                </div>
                <!-- This is the second column, which is also known via the
                     class attribute as "right-column". We also gave it the
                     name "content" using the identifier/id attribute.
                     One thing that may seem different here is we've now
                     included a "card-container" in the class attribute
                     alongside the "right-column". The thing is, we can
                     apply multiple "classes" or styles to elements by
                     delimiting/separating these with a space.
                     
                     However, the same is not true with the identifier/id attribute.
                     We can only give one unique ID to an element and you should
                     avoid giving other elements the same ID too, unless you'd want
                     the FBI (or NBI in our case) knocking at your doorstep. (joke)
                     
                     In this case, whatever style that is defined in CSS
                     for "right-column" and "card-container" will also be applied
                     to this element. 
                     
                     For this exercise, we'll divide content using "cards" and
                     apply the "card" concept for separating our content, similar
                     to the playing cards found in Solitaire or w/e card game
                     it is that you know. Since we intend to include "cards"
                     inside the content element, we'd also call it a 
                     "card-container" using the class attribute. -->
                <div id="content" class="right-column card-container">
                    <!-- This is the first card, and since we'd like this
                         to be styled the same with other cards, we included
                         "card" in the class attribute. Also, we'd be separating
                         this into two columns, which is why we're adding
                         "two-column" into the class attribute. -->
                    <div class="card two-column">
                        <!-- We intend to place an image in this column, so,
                             include "image-column" in its class attribute -->
                        <div class="image-column">
                            <!-- Tell the browser to show an image named "main.png" -->

                             in this column, so, include "content-column"

                                 here, so we'd enclose this "paragraph" using the "p" element. -->

                         set of cards inside it, we'd include "card-container" 
                         and "horizontal" in the class attribute. As stated earlier, CSS
                         will handle how this will be "displayed" or presented. -->
